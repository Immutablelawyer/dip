## Simple Summary

The purpose of this DIP is to reduce the liquidity provider rewards threshold for market makers from 1% to 0.25% so that smaller and medium-sized market makers can be included as well.

## Abstract

In reference to a thread on market maker incentives, Denis Tenchurin submitted a Snapshot vote to reduce the volume threshold % for market makers to qualify to receive Liquidity Provider Rewards.

The Snapshot vote concluded with a record 306 unique voters and 27M DYDX in agreement. The majority of the community (195 voters & 99.8% of DYDX) supported to reduce the threshold to 0.25%.

## Motivation

Having a high threshold of 1% is worse for liquidity on dYdX. It excludes smaller and small-sized market makers from competing with larger market makers.

28 more market makers would be included in the next epoch if the threshold had been reduced to 0.25%.

## Rationale

Reducing this threshold from 1% to 0.25% will provide better competition for tight quoting and uptime (especially on alt pairs, which have had quite wide spreads) and should result in better liquidity overall across dYdX Protocol.
